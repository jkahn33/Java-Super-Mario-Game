# Java Super Mario Game

This game was the final project for my second semester Java class in my freshmen year. Most of the game was already built; I was tasked with creating new enemies and adding in different things to make the game better. Some things that were added were powerups such as the invincibility star and a speed powerup to the tune of the Flash Gordon theme song. 

## To play the game:
1. Download the project into your preferred IDE. 
2. Run the ```Game Manager``` class in the ```com.brackeen.javagamebook.tilegame``` package.
